    <h1>About Me</h1>
    <p>I'm working  toward my personal and professional life to become an architect. I'm studying to success toward these goals. The values that I consider more necessary for my success are confidence and creativity.
      The short-term goals that I hope to accomplish in the near future are to have a good job that I will enjoy. The character traits and achievements that I most want to be known for are for having courage and integrity.</p>
